### Notes
After setting the background of my grid CollectionView to black, the title would be covered. And I tried to adjust the size of CollectionView by leaving some space for the title. But it looks a little bit wired to me (the color of the title would be different from the tab bar below). I am looking for the better way to make my title show.
